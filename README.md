ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ethanjped

I want to design and build software solutions to solve problems. In my present studies I am most interested in both software and system design, software security, and HCI research. 
Currently working in front-end web development in the .NET MVC framework, as well as on the sales floor pitching to people my favorite activity away from computers - running!

I plan on graduating in the spring of 2023 with Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Utah. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skillset and gain experience!
