ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ethanjped

I want to design and build software solutions to solve problems. In my present studies I am most interested in both learning web frameworks like React and Sveltekit, Android app development, and HCI research. 
I currently work professionally in web development using .NET ASP Web Forms and MVC, creating E-commerce sites and developing custom CRM software.


I plan on graduating in the spring of 2023 with Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Utah. Right now I am working on a senior project called TheraJournal. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skillset and gain experience!
